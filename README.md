# Janken-pon (Rock, Paper, Scissors) | Practice project

This is a simple rock, paper and scissor game which is played via browser console. Open your browser console using "f12" key to see the results of each round and the final winner. "Janken-pon" is japanese translation of  "rock, paper and scissors". I have written pseudo-code at the start of the script.js file explaining all the steps I took in making this game. I will add UI to this project very soon !
